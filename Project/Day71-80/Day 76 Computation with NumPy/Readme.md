## Ipynb (Google Colaboratory) using pandas Day 76

In this lesson we looked at how to:

1. Create arrays manually with np.array()
2. Generate arrays using  .arange(), .random(), and .linspace()
3. Analyse the shape and dimensions of a ndarray
4. Slice and subset a ndarray based on its indices
5. Do linear algebra like operations with scalars and matrix multiplication
6. Use NumPys broadcasting to make ndarray shapes compatible
7. Manipulate images in the form of ndarrays
